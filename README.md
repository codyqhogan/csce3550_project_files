All Python code is linted using pycodestyle with constraints in "setup.cfg", and then formatted using Black.

Main branch is the current Project code, additional branches are to retain the state at each Project stage.</br>
Note that in order to implement the AES encryption, I was required to add more attributes to the 'keys' table, which broke the gradebot. Thus, 'server.py' is the working code without AES encryption that passes the gradebot. And 'server_AES.py' is the working code with AES encryption that will not pass the gradebot.</br>
